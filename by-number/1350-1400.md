## 1351 Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix E

### D



Given a `m x n` matrix `grid` which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return _the number of **negative** numbers in_ `grid`.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]
Output: 0
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 100`
* `-100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`

### S

Fastest way: O(n+m)

* Start from right top
* If less than zero then move left
* If larger than zero then move down

```
class Solution:
    def countNegatives(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        c_len,r_len=len(grid[0]),len(grid)
        res = 0
        c_p = c_len - 1
        r_p = 0
        while r_p < r_len and c_p >= 0:
            if grid[r_p][c_p] < 0:
                res += r_len - r_p
                c_p -= 1
            else:
                r_p += 1
        
        return res 

```

## 1366 Rank Teams by Votes M

### D



In a special ranking system, each voter gives a rank from highest to lowest to all teams participated in the competition.

The ordering of teams is decided by who received the most position-one votes. If two or more teams tie in the first position, we consider the second position to resolve the conflict, if they tie again, we continue this process until the ties are resolved. If two or more teams are still tied after considering all positions, we rank them alphabetically based on their team letter.

Given an array of strings `votes` which is the votes of all voters in the ranking systems. Sort all teams according to the ranking system described above.

Return _a string of all teams_ **sorted** by the ranking system.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: votes = ["ABC","ACB","ABC","ACB","ACB"]
Output: "ACB"
Explanation: Team A was ranked first place by 5 voters. No other team was voted as first place so team A is the first team.
Team B was ranked second by 2 voters and was ranked third by 3 voters.
Team C was ranked second by 3 voters and was ranked third by 2 voters.
As most of the voters ranked C second, team C is the second team and team B is the third.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: votes = ["WXYZ","XYZW"]
Output: "XWYZ"
Explanation: X is the winner due to tie-breaking rule. X has same votes as W for the first position but X has one vote as second position while W doesn't have any votes as second position. 
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: votes = ["ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK"]
Output: "ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK"
Explanation: Only one voter so his votes are used for the ranking.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= votes.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= votes[i].length <= 26`
* `votes[i].length == votes[j].length` for `0 <= i, j < votes.length`.
* `votes[i][j]` is an English **uppercase** letter.
* All characters of `votes[i]` are unique.
* All the characters that occur in `votes[0]` **also occur** in `votes[j]` where `1 <= j < votes.length`.

### S

* Create a hash map to store the team name and relative score
* Sort based on the score first and then name

```
class Solution:
    def rankTeams(self, votes: List[str]) -> str:
        n = len(votes)

        # You don't know each teams name, so have to create a hash map to 
        #   store the name and the value 
        name_rank_freq = collections.defaultdict(lambda : [0] * len(votes[0]))
        for vote in votes:
            for i, name in enumerate(vote):
                name_rank_freq[name][i] += 1
        
        tmp = list(name_rank_freq.items())
        # Sort based on the score in x[1] in order, x[1] is a list
        # if same, then sort based on ord(x[0])
        tmp.sort(key = lambda x: (x[1], -ord(x[0])) , reverse = True)

        return "".join([vid for vid, rank in tmp])

```

## 1372 Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree

### D



You are given the `root` of a binary tree.

A ZigZag path for a binary tree is defined as follow:

* Choose **any** node in the binary tree and a direction (right or left).
* If the current direction is right, move to the right child of the current node; otherwise, move to the left child.
* Change the direction from right to left or from left to right.
* Repeat the second and third steps until you can't move in the tree.

Zigzag length is defined as the number of nodes visited - 1. (A single node has a length of 0).

Return _the longest **ZigZag** path contained in that tree_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/22/sample\_1\_1702.png)

```
Input: root = [1,null,1,1,1,null,null,1,1,null,1,null,null,null,1,null,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (right -> left -> right).
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/22/sample\_2\_1702.png)

```
Input: root = [1,1,1,null,1,null,null,1,1,null,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (left -> right -> left -> right).
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 0
```
