## 1663 Smallest String With A Given Numeric Value M

### D



The **numeric value** of a **lowercase character** is defined as its position `(1-indexed)` in the alphabet, so the numeric value of `a` is `1`, the numeric value of `b` is `2`, the numeric value of `c` is `3`, and so on.

The **numeric value** of a **string** consisting of lowercase characters is defined as the sum of its characters' numeric values. For example, the numeric value of the string `"abe"` is equal to `1 + 2 + 5 = 8`.

You are given two integers `n` and `k`. Return _the **lexicographically smallest string** with **length** equal to `n` and **numeric value** equal to `k`._

Note that a string `x` is lexicographically smaller than string `y` if `x` comes before `y` in dictionary order, that is, either `x` is a prefix of `y`, or if `i` is the first position such that `x[i] != y[i]`, then `x[i]` comes before `y[i]` in alphabetic order.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, k = 27
Output: "aay"
Explanation: The numeric value of the string is 1 + 1 + 25 = 27, and it is the smallest string with such a value and length equal to 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5, k = 73
Output: "aaszz"
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 105`
* `n <= k <= 26 * n`

### S

Start from end compare the k value and the number of bit times 26

```
class Solution:
    def getSmallestString(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        ans = list()
        for rest in range(n, 0, -1):
            bound = k - 26 * (rest - 1)
            if bound > 0:
                ans.append(chr(bound + 96))
                k -= bound
            else:
                ans.append("a")
                k -= 1
        return "".join(ans)
```

## 1676 Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree IV

### D



Given the `root` of a binary tree and an array of `TreeNode` objects `nodes`, return _the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of **all the nodes** in_ `nodes`. All the nodes will exist in the tree, and all values of the tree's nodes are **unique**.

Extending the [**definition of LCA on Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest\_common\_ancestor): "The lowest common ancestor of `n` nodes `p1`, `p2`, ..., `pn` in a binary tree `T` is the lowest node that has every `pi` as a **descendant** (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**) for every valid `i`". A **descendant** of a node `x` is a node `y` that is on the path from node `x` to some leaf node.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], nodes = [4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The lowest common ancestor of nodes 4 and 7 is node 2.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], nodes = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The lowest common ancestor of a single node is the node itself.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], nodes = [7,6,2,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: The lowest common ancestor of the nodes 7, 6, 2, and 4 is node 5.
