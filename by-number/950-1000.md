## 935. Knight Dialer

### Description:

The chess knight has a **unique movement**, it may move two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically (with both forming the shape of an **L**). The possible movements of chess knight are shown in this diagaram:

A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:

We have a chess knight and a phone pad as shown below, the knight **can only stand on a numeric cell** (i.e. blue cell).

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/18/phone.jpg)

Given an integer `n`, return how many distinct phone numbers of length `n` we can dial.

You are allowed to place the knight **on any numeric cell** initially and then you should perform `n - 1` jumps to dial a number of length `n`. All jumps should be **valid** knight jumps.

As the answer may be very large, **return the answer modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 10
Explanation: We need to dial a number of length 1, so placing the knight over any numeric cell of the 10 cells is sufficient.
```

### Solution:

**DP:**

1. Change the dial table to a graph: If you start from 1 then you can go to 8 and 6; from 0 you can go 4 or 6.

2\. Seperate all numbers into four different sets:

* Set A: 1, 3, 7, 9: Symmetry to each other based on 4 0 6 line
* Set B: 2, 8
* Set C: 4, 6
* Set D: 0

3\. Transition function:

f(x, n): move n step, the destination is x number. E.g.: f(2, 3): move three steps to 2

f(A,n)=f(B,n-1)+f(C,n-1): if you want to go to A, prev step must be at B or C

f(B,n)=2\_f(A,n-1): Two former step are all at A\_

\_f(C,n)=2\_f(A,n-1)+f(D,n-1): C are linked with 0; so it has three resources

f(D,n)=2\*f(C,n-1)

4\. Code

```

class Solution:
    def knightDialer(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 1:
            return 10
        
        # amount of different number that you can get in set A B C D
        nums = [1, 1, 1, 1]
        for i in range(n-1):
            nums = [nums[1]+nums[2], 2 * nums[0], 2*nums[0]+nums[3], 2*nums[2]]
            
        # 4 numbers in Set A, two in B, two in C, one in D
        return(4*nums[0] + 2*nums[1] + 2*nums[2] + nums[3])%1000000007
