## 402 Remove K Digits M

### D



Given string num representing a non-negative integer `num`, and an integer `k`, return _the smallest possible integer after removing_ `k` _digits from_ `num`.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: num = "10", k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= k <= num.length <= 105`
* `num` consists of only digits.
* `num` does not have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.

### s

Given a sequence of digits \[D\_1D\_2D\_3...D\_n]\[D 1 ​ D 2 ​ D 3 ​ ...D n ​ ], if the digit D\_2D 2 ​ is less than its left neighbor D\_1D 1 ​ , then we should remove the left neighbor (D\_1D 1 ​ ) in order to obtain the minimum result.

* when we get out of the main loop, we removed `m` digits, which is _less than asked_, _i.e._(`m < k`). In the extreme case, we would not remove any digit for the monotonic increasing sequence in the loop, _i.e._ `m==0`. In this case, we just need to remove the additional `k-m` digits from the tail of the sequence.
* &#x20;once we remove all the `k` digits from the sequence, there could be some leading zeros left. To format the final number, we need to strip off those leading zeros.
* we might end up removing all numbers from the sequence. In this case, we should return zero, instead of empty string.

```
class Solution:
    def removeKdigits(self, num: str, k: int) -> str:
        res = []
        
        for digit in num:
            while k and res and res[-1] > digit:
                res.pop()
                k -= 1
            res.append(digit)
        final_res = res[:-k] if k else res
        return "".join(final_res).lstrip("0") or "0"
```

## 406 Queue Reconstruction by Height

### Description



You are given an array of people, `people`, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each `people[i] = [hi, ki]` represents the `ith` person of height `hi` with **exactly** `ki` other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to `hi`.

Reconstruct and return _the queue that is represented by the input array_ `people`. The returned queue should be formatted as an array `queue`, where `queue[j] = [hj, kj]` is the attributes of the `jth` person in the queue (`queue[0]` is the person at the front of the queue).

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
Explanation:
Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.
Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= people.length <= 2000`
* `0 <= hi <= 106`
* `0 <= ki < people.length`
* It is guaranteed that the queue can be reconstructed.

### Solution

* All the people who is shorter than ith people will not be counted in ki value
* But the people who is higher than ith people will affect the ki value
* So we first insert higher people and then insert the shorter guy later
* Sort the list based on height first and then the position
* Insert the people into the ki position, higher first and shorter later&#x20;

```
// Sort
class Solution:
    def reconstructQueue(self, people: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # sort list based on height first and then order 
        people.sort(key = lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))
        # create a queue to store the result
        res = []
        
        for i in people:
            res.insert(i[1], i)
        return res
```

## 408 Valid Word Abbreviation E

### Description



A string can be **abbreviated** by replacing any number of **non-adjacent**, **non-empty** substrings with their lengths. The lengths **should not** have leading zeros.

For example, a string such as `"substitution"` could be abbreviated as (but not limited to):

* `"s10n"` (`"s ubstitutio n"`)
* `"sub4u4"` (`"sub stit u tion"`)
* `"12"` (`"substitution"`)
* `"su3i1u2on"` (`"su bst i t u ti on"`)
* `"substitution"` (no substrings replaced)

The following are **not valid** abbreviations:

* `"s55n"` (`"s ubsti tutio n"`, the replaced substrings are adjacent)
* `"s010n"` (has leading zeros)
* `"s0ubstitution"` (replaces an empty substring)

Given a string `word` and an abbreviation `abbr`, return _whether the string **matches** the given abbreviation_.

A **substring** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of characters within a string.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word = "internationalization", abbr = "i12iz4n"
Output: true
Explanation: The word "internationalization" can be abbreviated as "i12iz4n" ("i nternational iz atio n").
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word = "apple", abbr = "a2e"
Output: false
Explanation: The word "apple" cannot be abbreviated as "a2e".
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= word.length <= 20`
* `word` consists of only lowercase English letters.
* `1 <= abbr.length <= 10`
* `abbr` consists of lowercase English letters and digits.
* All the integers in `abbr` will fit in a 32-bit integer.

### Solution

1. Two pointers
2. Many situations:
   1. is not digit: if two value not equal, return false
   2. is not digit: else go next
   3. is digit: if first digit is 0 return false
   4. is digit: if not 0, get the number by while loop

```
// O(N) O(1)
class Solution:
    def validWordAbbreviation(self, word: str, abbr: str) -> bool:
        p1 = p2 = 0
        while p1 < len(word) and p2 < len(abbr):
            if abbr[p2].isdigit():
                if abbr[p2] == '0': # leading zeros are invalid
                    return False
                shift = 0
                while p2 < len(abbr) and abbr[p2].isdigit():
                    shift = (shift*10)+int(abbr[p2])
                    p2 += 1
                p1 += shift
            else:
                if word[p1] != abbr[p2]:
                    return False
                p1 += 1
                p2 += 1
        return p1 == len(word) and p2 == len(abbr)
        
```

## 410 Split Array Largest Sum H

### D



Given an array `nums` which consists of non-negative integers and an integer `m`, you can split the array into `m` non-empty continuous subarrays.

Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these `m` subarrays.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], m = 2
Output: 18
Explanation:
There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], m = 2
Output: 9
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,4,4], m = 3
Output: 4
```

### S

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def splitArray(self, nums: List[int], m: int) -> int:
        def min_subarrys_required(max_sum_allowed: int):
            current_sum = 0 
            splits_required = 0
            
            for e in nums:
                if current_sum + e <= max_sum_allowed:
                    current_sum += e
                else:
                    current_sum = e
                    splits_required += 1
            return splits_required + 1
        
        l = max(nums)
        r = sum(nums)
        while l <= r:
            max_sum_allowed = (l + r)//2
            
            if min_subarrys_required(max_sum_allowed) <= m:
                r = max_sum_allowed - 1
                minimum_largest_split_sum = max_sum_allowed
            else:
                l = max_sum_allowed + 1
        return minimum_largest_split_sum
```



## 423 Reconstruct Original Digits from English M

### D



Given a string `s` containing an out-of-order English representation of digits `0-9`, return _the digits in **ascending** order_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "owoztneoer"
Output: "012"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "fviefuro"
Output: "45"
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 105`
* `s[i]` is one of the characters `["e","g","f","i","h","o","n","s","r","u","t","w","v","x","z"]`.
* `s` is **guaranteed** to be valid.

### S

* create a hash map
* store the unique letter
* calculate the others

```
class Solution:
    def originalDigits(self, s: str) -> str:
        count = collections.Counter(s)
        
        # building hashmap digit -> its frequency 
        out = {}
        # letter "z" is present only in "zero"
        out["0"] = count["z"]
        # letter "w" is present only in "two"
        out["2"] = count["w"]
        # letter "u" is present only in "four"
        out["4"] = count["u"]
        # letter "x" is present only in "six"
        out["6"] = count["x"]
        # letter "g" is present only in "eight"
        out["8"] = count["g"]
        # letter "h" is present only in "three" and "eight"
        out["3"] = count["h"] - out["8"]
        # letter "f" is present only in "five" and "four"
        out["5"] = count["f"] - out["4"]
        # letter "s" is present only in "seven" and "six"
        out["7"] = count["s"] - out["6"]
        # letter "i" is present in "nine", "five", "six", and "eight"
        out["9"] = count["i"] - out["5"] - out["6"] - out["8"]
        # letter "n" is present in "one", "nine", and "seven"
        out["1"] = count["n"] - out["7"] - 2 * out["9"]
        
        res = [ k * out[k] for k in sorted(out.keys())]
        return "".join(res)
```

## 424 Longest Repeating Character Replacement M

### D



You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

Return _the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 105`
* `s` consists of only uppercase English letters.
* `0 <= k <= s.length`

### S

* Sliding window,&#x20;
* Make sure the other char in sliding window less than k

```
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        
        l, r = 0, 0
        hashmap = collections.defaultdict(int)
        # Var to store the value in hashmap with largest frequency
        max_freq = 0
        res = 0
        
        while r < n:
            hashmap[s[r]] += 1
            max_freq = max(hashmap[s[r]], max_freq)
            
            if (r-l+1) - max_freq <= k:
                res = max(res, r-l+1)
            else:
                hashmap[s[l]] -= 1
                l += 1
            r += 1
        return res
```

## 427 Construct Quad Tree M

### D



Given a `n * n` matrix `grid` of `0's` and `1's` only. We want to represent the `grid` with a Quad-Tree.

Return _the root of the Quad-Tree_ representing the `grid`.

Notice that you can assign the value of a node to **True** or **False** when `isLeaf` is **False**, and both are **accepted** in the answer.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

* `val`: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.
* `isLeaf`: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.

```
class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
```

We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

1. If the current grid has the same value (i.e all `1's` or all `0's`) set `isLeaf` True and set `val` to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
2. If the current grid has different values, set `isLeaf` to False and set `val` to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
3. Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/11/new\_top.png)

If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree).

**Quad-Tree format:**

The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where `null` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list `[isLeaf, val]`.

If the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is True we represent it as **1** in the list `[isLeaf, val]` and if the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is False we represent it as **0**.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/11/grid1.png)

```
Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The explanation of this example is shown below:
Notice that 0 represnts False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/12/e2mat.png)

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
Explanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.
The topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.
The topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.
Explanation is shown in the photo below:
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `n == grid.length == grid[i].length`
* `n == 2x` where `0 <= x <= 6`

## 428 Serialize and Deserialize N-ary Tree H

### D



Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize an N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

For example, you may serialize the following `3-ary` tree

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/narytreeexample.png)

&#x20;

as `[1 [3[5 6] 2 4]]`. Note that this is just an example, you do not necessarily need to follow this format.

Or you can follow LeetCode's level order traversal serialization format, where each group of children is separated by the null value.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/08/sample\_4\_964.png)

&#x20;

For example, the above tree may be serialized as `[1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]`.

You do not necessarily need to follow the above-suggested formats, there are many more different formats that work so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

## 430 Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List M

### D



You are given a doubly linked list, which contains nodes that have a next pointer, a previous pointer, and an additional **child pointer**. This child pointer may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list, also containing these special nodes. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a **multilevel data structure** as shown in the example below.

Given the `head` of the first level of the list, **flatten** the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. Let `curr` be a node with a child list. The nodes in the child list should appear **after** `curr` and **before** `curr.next` in the flattened list.

Return _the_ `head` _of the flattened list. The nodes in the list must have **all** of their child pointers set to_ `null`.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/09/flatten11.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
Output: [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]
Explanation: The multilevel linked list in the input is shown.
After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/09/flatten2.1jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,null,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Explanation: The multilevel linked list in the input is shown.
After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
Explanation: There could be empty list in the input.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* The number of Nodes will not exceed `1000`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 105`

&#x20;

**How the multilevel linked list is represented in test cases:**

We use the multilevel linked list from **Example 1** above:

```
 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL
```

The serialization of each level is as follows:

```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]
```

To serialize all levels together, we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:

```
[1,    2,    3, 4, 5, 6, null]
             |
[null, null, 7,    8, 9, 10, null]
                   |
[            null, 11, 12, null]
```

Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain:

```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
```

## 438 Find All Anagrams in a String M

### Description



Given two strings `s` and `p`, return _an array of all the start indices of_ `p`_'s anagrams in_ `s`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104`
* `s` and `p` consist of lowercase English letters.

### Solution

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        ns, np = len(s), len(p)
        counter_s = collections.Counter(s[0: np])
        counter_p = collections.Counter(p)
        
        res = []
        if counter_s == counter_p:
            res.append(0)
        for i in range(1, ns-np+1):
            if counter_s[s[i-1]] > 1:
                counter_s[s[i-1]] -= 1
            else:
                del counter_s[s[i-1]]
            counter_s[s[i+np-1]] += 1
            if counter_s == counter_p:
                res.append(i)

## 441 Arranging Coins E

### D



You have `n` coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of `k` rows where the `ith` row has exactly `i` coins. The last row of the staircase **may be** incomplete.

Given the integer `n`, return _the number of **complete rows** of the staircase you will build_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

## 445 Add Two Numbers II M

### D



You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/09/sumii-linked-list.jpg)

```
Input: l1 = [7,2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,8,0,7]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [8,0,7]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
* `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
* It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

### S

* Find the length of both lists: `n1` and `n2`.
* Parse both lists and sum the corresponding positions without taking carry into account, i.e. convert `3->3->3` + `7->7` into `3->10->10` and then into `10->10->3`.
  * To sum the corresponding positions, do the following:
    * If `n1 >= n2`, add to the current value the value of the node from the first list, and decrease the number of elements to parse: `n1 -= 1`. (**Special situation: if n1 == n2, then after n1 - 1, n1 will less than n2, so current value will plus n1 first then plus n2**)
    * If `n1 < n2`, add to the current value the value of the node from the second list and decrease the number of elements to parse: `n2 -= 1`.
  * Update the result by adding the current value to the front.
* Now it's time to take care about the carry, to limit each node value by 9, i.e. to convert `10->10->3` into `0->1->4` and then into `4->1->0`:
  * Initialize the carry `carry = 0`.
  * Re-initialize the current list: `curr1 = head` and the output list: `head = None`.
  * Parse the current list `curr1`:
    * Normalize the current value to be less than 10: `val = (curr1.val + carry) % 10`, and keep the carry: `carry = (curr1.val + carry) // 10`.
    * Update the result by adding the current value to front.
    * Move to the next element in the list: `curr1 = curr1.next`.
* If the carry is not equal to zero, append it to frond of the result list.
* Return the result list: `return head`.

## 450 Delete Node in a BST M

### D



Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

1. Search for a node to remove.
2. If the node is found, delete the node.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/04/del\_node\_1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [], key = 0
Output: []
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
* `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
* Each node has a **unique** value.
* `root` is a valid binary search tree.
* `-105 <= key <= 105`
