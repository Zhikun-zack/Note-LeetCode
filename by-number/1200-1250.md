## 1218 Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference Medium

### Description

Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `difference`, return the length of the longest subsequence in `arr` which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals `difference`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from `arr` by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr.length <= 105`
* `-104 <= arr[i], difference <= 104`

### Solution

DP

* Not using list, but hashmap
* dp\[i] = dp\[i-diff] + 1
* init value of each dp is 0

```
// DP
class Solution:
    def longestSubsequence(self, arr: List[int], difference: int) -> int:
        dp = defaultdict(int)

        for a in arr:
            dp[a] = dp[a-difference] + 1
        return max(dp.values())
```

## 1245 Tree Diameter M

### D



The **diameter** of a tree is **the number of edges** in the longest path in that tree.

There is an undirected tree of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D array `edges` where `edges.length == n - 1` and `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.

Return _the **diameter** of the tree_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/01/19/tree1.jpg)

```
Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest path of the tree is the path 1 - 0 - 2.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/01/19/tree2.jpg)

```
Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest path of the tree is the path 3 - 2 - 1 - 4 - 5.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `n == edges.length + 1`
* `1 <= n <= 104`
* `0 <= ai, bi < n`
* `ai != bi`

        for edge in edges:

            nonlocal res
            
            distance = 0 # used to store the longest length of the neighbor tree
            top1, top2 = 0, 0 # Top two child tree length, sum will be one of the res

                # If this neighbor hasn't been visited
                if not visited[n]:
                    distance = 1 + dfs(n, visited) 
                
                # Update the top1 and top2 based on the returned value
                if distance >top1:
                    top1, top2 = distance, top1
                elif distance > top2:
                    top2 = distance
                
                # Maintain the res value
                res = max(res, top1 + top2)
            
            # Return the longest child tree length not diameter
            return top1
        
        visited = [False for i in range(len(graph))]
        dfs(0, visited)
        return res
```

## 1248 Count Number of Nice Subarrays M

### Description



Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. A continuous subarray is called **nice** if there are `k` odd numbers on it.

Return _the number of **nice** sub-arrays_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,1,1], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The only sub-arrays with 3 odd numbers are [1,1,2,1] and [1,2,1,1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,4,6], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no odd numbers in the array.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,2], k = 2
Output: 16
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 50000`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
* `1 <= k <= nums.length`
