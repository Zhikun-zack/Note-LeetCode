## 1218 Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference Medium

### Description

Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `difference`, return the length of the longest subsequence in `arr` which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals `difference`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from `arr` by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr.length <= 105`
* `-104 <= arr[i], difference <= 104`

### Solution

DP

* Not using list, but hashmap
* dp\[i] = dp\[i-diff] + 1
* init value of each dp is 0

```
// DP
class Solution:
    def longestSubsequence(self, arr: List[int], difference: int) -> int:
        dp = defaultdict(int)

        for a in arr:
            dp[a] = dp[a-difference] + 1
        return max(dp.values())
```

## 1277 Count Square Submatrices with All Ones M

### Description



Given a `m * n` matrix of ones and zeros, return how many **square** submatrices have all ones.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix =
[
  [0,1,1,1],
  [1,1,1,1],
  [0,1,1,1]
]
Output: 15
Explanation: 
There are 10 squares of side 1.
There are 4 squares of side 2.
There is  1 square of side 3.
Total number of squares = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matrix = 
[
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,0],
  [1,1,0]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
There are 6 squares of side 1.  
There is 1 square of side 2. 
Total number of squares = 6 + 1 = 7.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr.length <= 300`
* `1 <= arr[0].length <= 300`
* `0 <= arr[i][j] <= 1`

### Solution

DP&#x20;

1. init
2. dp\[i]\[j] = min(dp\[i-1]\[j], dp\[i]\[j-1], dp\[i-1]\[j-1]) + 1

```
// DP
class Solution:
    def countSquares(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        r_n, c_n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        
        dp =[[0 for _ in range (c_n)] for _ in range(r_n)]
        
        # init
        for i in range(r_n):
            dp[i][0] = matrix[i][0]
        for j in range(1, c_n):
            dp[0][j] = matrix[0][j]
            
        # Main process
        for i in range(1, r_n):
            for j in range(1, c_n):
                if matrix[i][j] == 1:
                    dp[i][j] = min(min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]), dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
                else:
                    continue

        res = 0
        for i in range(r_n):
            for j in range(c_n):
                res += dp[i][j]
        return res
```
