## 826 Most Profit Assigning Work M

### D



You have `n` jobs and `m` workers. You are given three arrays: `difficulty`, `profit`, and `worker` where:

* `difficulty[i]` and `profit[i]` are the difficulty and the profit of the `ith` job, and
* `worker[j]` is the ability of `jth` worker (i.e., the `jth` worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most `worker[j]`).

Every worker can be assigned **at most one job**, but one job can be **completed multiple times**.

* For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays `$1`, then the total profit will be `$3`. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is `$0`.

Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]
Output: 100
Explanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get a profit of [20,20,30,30] separately.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: difficulty = [85,47,57], profit = [24,66,99], worker = [40,25,25]
Output: 0
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `n == difficulty.length`
* `n == profit.length`
* `m == worker.length`
* `1 <= n, m <= 104`
* `1 <= difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i] <= 105`

### S

* Sort the combination of difficulty and profit based on difficulty, make sure if the worker can take the job i then he will also be able to take the job i-1
* Then calculate the prefix of the profit, make sure the prefix is also increasing
* Do binary search, find the last difficulty which is less than the worker, and add the largest profit from 0 to i

        dp.sort(key = lambda x: x[0])

                #   largestProfit will be changed 
                largestProfit[i] = max(dp[i][1], largestProfit[i-1])
        res = 0
        for w in worker:
            # if worker less than the smallest
            if w < dp[0][0]:
                res += 0

                    if dp[mid][0] <= w:
                        l = mid + 1
                    else:
                        r = mid 
                if dp[l][0] <= w:
                    res += largestProfit[l]
                else:
                    res += largestProfit[l-1]
        return res

## 837 New 21 Game M

### D



Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game **"21"**.

Alice starts with `0` points and draws numbers while she has less than `k` points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range `[1, maxPts]`, where `maxPts` is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets `k` **or more points**.

Return the probability that Alice has `n` or fewer points.

Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer are considered accepted.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 10, k = 1, maxPts = 10
Output: 1.00000
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 6, k = 1, maxPts = 10
Output: 0.60000
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.
In 6 out of 10 possibilities, she is at or below 6 points.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 21, k = 17, maxPts = 10
Output: 0.73278
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= k <= n <= 104`
* `1 <= maxPts <= 104`
