## 760 Maximum Swap

### Description



You are given an integer `num`. You can swap two digits at most once to get the maximum valued number.

Return _the maximum valued number you can get_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = 2736
Output: 7236
Explanation: Swap the number 2 and the number 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = 9973
Output: 9973
Explanation: No swap.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= num <= 108`

### Solution

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def maximumSwap(self, num: int) -> int:
        # larger digit to swap, digit position of this digit
        high_digit = high_pos = 0
        
        # smaller digit to swap, digit position of this digit
        low_digit = low_pos = 0
        
        # greatest digit seen so far, digit postion of this digit
        cur_high_digit, cur_high_pos = -1, 0
        
        # current digit position
        pos = 1
        
        res = num
        while num: # iterate through digits from right to left
            digit = num % 10
            
            # if digit is greatest digit yet
            if digit > cur_high_digit:
                cur_high_digit, cur_high_pos = digit, pos
            
            # if digit is less than greatest digit yet
            elif digit < cur_high_digit:
                # set the digits to swap as the greatest digit yet, and this digit
                high_digit, high_pos = cur_high_digit, cur_high_pos
                low_digit, low_pos = digit, pos
            
            pos *= 10
            num //= 10
        
        # swap the digits
        res += high_digit*(low_pos - high_pos) + low_digit*(high_pos - low_pos)
        return res
```

## 763 Partition Labels

### Description



You are given a string `s`. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.

Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be `s`.

Return _a list of integers representing the size of these parts_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"
Output: [10]
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 500`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

### Solution

* Do some preprocessing, sort the list and then store the anchor

```
//
class Solution(object):
    def partitionLabels(self, S):
        last = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(S)}
        j = anchor = 0
        ans = []
        for i, c in enumerate(S):
            j = max(j, last[c])
            if i == j:
                ans.append(i - anchor + 1)
                anchor = i + 1
            
        return ans
```

## 769 Max Chunks To Make Sorted M

### Description



You are given an integer array `arr` of length `n` that represents a permutation of the integers in the range `[0, n - 1]`.

We split `arr` into some number of **chunks** (i.e., partitions), and individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result should equal the sorted array.

Return _the largest number of chunks we can make to sort the array_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [4,3,2,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
For example, splitting into [4, 3], [2, 1, 0] will result in [3, 4, 0, 1, 2], which isn't sorted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
We can split into two chunks, such as [1, 0], [2, 3, 4].
However, splitting into [1, 0], [2], [3], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `n == arr.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10`
* `0 <= arr[i] < n`
* All the elements of `arr` are **unique**.&#x20;

### Solution

* range from \[0, n-1] ! Which means after sorted, result will be equal to thestart  index&#x20;
* Start from most left, save the max value
* if max === idx: can separate as a block
* else: go next

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def maxChunksToSorted(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        max_val = 0
        for i, x in enumerate(arr):
            max_val = max(max_val, x)
            if max_val == i:
                res += 1
        return res
```

## 790 Domino and Tromino Tiling

### Description

You have two types of tiles: a `2 x 1` domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/15/lc-domino.jpg)

Given an integer n, return _the number of ways to tile an_ `2 x n` _board_. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/15/lc-domino1.jpg)

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: The five different ways are show above.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 1000`

```
// DP Opt
class Solution:
    def numTilings(self, n: int) -> int:
        MOD = 1_000_000_007
        if n <= 2:
            return n
        fPrevious = 1
        fCurrent = 2
        pCurrent = 1
        for k in range(3, n + 1):
            tmp = fCurrent
            fCurrent = (fCurrent + fPrevious + 2 * pCurrent) % MOD
            pCurrent = (pCurrent + fPrevious) % MOD
            fPrevious = tmp
        return fCurrent
```

## 791 Custom Sort String M

### D



You are given two strings order and s. All the words of `order` are **unique** and were sorted in some custom order previously.

Permute the characters of `s` so that they match the order that `order` was sorted. More specifically, if a character `x` occurs before a character `y` in `order`, then `x` should occur before `y` in the permuted string.

Return _any permutation of_ `s` _that satisfies this property_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: order = "cba", s = "abcd"
Output: "cbad"
Explanation: 
"a", "b", "c" appear in order, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a". 
Since "d" does not appear in order, it can be at any position in the returned string. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: order = "cbafg", s = "abcd"
Output: "cbad"
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= order.length <= 26`
* `1 <= s.length <= 200`
* `order` and `s` consist of lowercase English letters.
* All the characters of `order` are **unique**.

### S

* count all elements in string
* First traverse order string, sort by its order
* Second traverse s string, sort the left character
* O(N+M) O(N)

```
class Solution:
    def customSortString(self, order: str, s: str) -> str:
        count = collections.Counter(s)
        res = []
        
        # First go through all character in order
        for c in order:
            # count[c] is the number of c in string s
            # count[c] times c will return all duplicated c
            res.append(count[c] * c)
            # Have appended all character, remove this c in count
            count[c] = 0
        
        # Second go through all characther in s and not in order
        for c in count:
            res.append(count[c] * c)
        
        return "".join(res)
```
