## 452 Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons M



There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]` denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter** stretches between `xstart` and `xend`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically** (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `xstart` and `xend` is **burst** by an arrow shot at `x` if `xstart <= x <= xend`. There is **no limit** to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array `points`, return _the **minimum** number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= points.length <= 105`
* `points[i].length == 2`
* `-231 <= xstart < xend <= 231 - 1`

### `Solution`

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not points:
            return 0
        
        # sort by x_end
        points.sort(key = lambda x : x[1])
        
        arrows = 1
        first_end = points[0][1]
        for x_start, x_end in points:
            # if the current balloon starts after the end of another one,
            # one needs one more arrow
            if first_end < x_start:
                arrows += 1
                first_end = x_end
        
        return arrows
```

## 493 Reverse Pairs H

### D



Given an integer array `nums`, return _the number of **reverse pairs** in the array_.

A reverse pair is a pair `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < nums.length` and `nums[i] > 2 * nums[j]`.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,2,3,1]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,4,3,5,1]
Output: 3
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104`
* `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`

### S

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def reversePairs(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # increasing order 
        # and the value in it index will less than the current value
        sorted_arr = []
        res = 0
        
        for n in nums:
            # Find the value less and equal to n*2 (n[i] need larger than 2*n[j] no equal)
            # And since the value in the array is ahead of n so i<j
            num_large = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_arr, n*2)
            # Get the number of nums which larger than 2*n[i]
            # current n is n[j], calculated number is the amount of n[i]
            res_of_thisn = len(sorted_arr) - num_large
            res += res_of_thisn
            
            # Insert to array, make sure increase order
            bisect.insort_right(sorted_arr, n)
        return res
```
