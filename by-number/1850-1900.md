## 1891 Cutting Ribbons M

### D



You are given an integer array `ribbons`, where `ribbons[i]` represents the length of the `ith` ribbon, and an integer `k`. You may cut any of the ribbons into any number of segments of **positive integer** lengths, or perform no cuts at all.

* For example, if you have a ribbon of length `4`, you can:
  * Keep the ribbon of length `4`,
  * Cut it into one ribbon of length `3` and one ribbon of length `1`,
  * Cut it into two ribbons of length `2`,
  * Cut it into one ribbon of length `2` and two ribbons of length `1`, or
  * Cut it into four ribbons of length `1`.

Your goal is to obtain `k` ribbons of all the **same positive integer length**. You are allowed to throw away any excess ribbon as a result of cutting.

Return _the **maximum** possible positive integer length that you can obtain_ `k` _ribbons of, or_ `0` _if you cannot obtain_ `k` _ribbons of the same length_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ribbons = [9,7,5], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
- Cut the first ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 5 and one of length 4.
- Cut the second ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 5 and one of length 2.
- Keep the third ribbon as it is.
Now you have 3 ribbons of length 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ribbons = [7,5,9], k = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
- Cut the first ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 4 and one of length 3.
- Cut the second ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 4 and one of length 1.
- Cut the third ribbon to three ribbons, two of length 4 and one of length 1.
Now you have 4 ribbons of length 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: ribbons = [5,7,9], k = 22
Output: 0
Explanation: You cannot obtain k ribbons of the same positive integer length.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= ribbons.length <= 105`
* `1 <= ribbons[i] <= 105`
* `1 <= k <= 109`
