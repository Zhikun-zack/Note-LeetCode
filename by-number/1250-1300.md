## 1277 Count Square Submatrices with All Ones M

### Description

Given a `m * n` matrix of ones and zeros, return how many **square** submatrices have all ones.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix =
[
  [0,1,1,1],
  [1,1,1,1],
  [0,1,1,1]
]
Output: 15
Explanation: 
There are 10 squares of side 1.
There are 4 squares of side 2.
There is  1 square of side 3.
Total number of squares = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matrix = 
[
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,0],
  [1,1,0]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
There are 6 squares of side 1.  
There is 1 square of side 2. 
Total number of squares = 6 + 1 = 7.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr.length <= 300`
* `1 <= arr[0].length <= 300`
* `0 <= arr[i][j] <= 1`

### Solution

DP

1. init
2. dp\[i]\[j] = min(dp\[i-1]\[j], dp\[i]\[j-1], dp\[i-1]\[j-1]) + 1

```
// DP
class Solution:
    def countSquares(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        r_n, c_n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        
        dp =[[0 for _ in range (c_n)] for _ in range(r_n)]
        
        # init
        for i in range(r_n):
            dp[i][0] = matrix[i][0]
        for j in range(1, c_n):
            dp[0][j] = matrix[0][j]
            
        # Main process
        for i in range(1, r_n):
            for j in range(1, c_n):
                if matrix[i][j] == 1:
                    dp[i][j] = min(min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]), dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
                else:
                    continue

        res = 0
        for i in range(r_n):
            for j in range(c_n):
                res += dp[i][j]
        return res
```

## 1283 Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold M

### D



Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `threshold`, we will choose a positive integer `divisor`, divide all the array by it, and sum the division's result. Find the **smallest** `divisor` such that the result mentioned above is less than or equal to `threshold`.

Each result of the division is rounded to the nearest integer greater than or equal to that element. (For example: `7/3 = 3` and `10/2 = 5`).

The test cases are generated so that there will be an answer.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,5,9], threshold = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: We can get a sum to 17 (1+2+5+9) if the divisor is 1. 
If the divisor is 4 we can get a sum of 7 (1+1+2+3) and if the divisor is 5 the sum will be 5 (1+1+1+2). 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [44,22,33,11,1], threshold = 5
Output: 44
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 106`
* `nums.length <= threshold <= 106`

### S

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def smallestDivisor(self, nums: List[int], threshold: int) -> int:
        l, r = 1, max(nums)
        while l < r:
            mid = l + (r-l)//2
            sum_val = 0
            for i in nums:
                sum_val += math.ceil(i/mid)
            if sum_val > threshold:
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                r = mid 
        return l
```

## 1288 Remove Covered Intervals M

### D



Given an array `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [li, ri]` represent the interval `[li, ri)`, remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list.

The interval `[a, b)` is covered by the interval `[c, d)` if and only if `c <= a` and `b <= d`.

Return _the number of remaining intervals_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], therefore it is removed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,3]]
Output: 1
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= intervals.length <= 1000`
* `intervals[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= li < ri <= 105`
* All the given intervals are **unique**.

### S

* Sort based on the start&#x20;
* traverse all the end value in the sorted list&#x20;
* maintain a var for the farthest end, if and only if when the new end value larger than it, should we update its value
* compare the current end with the largest end, if this end is larger than the largest end, means current interval is not covered by the previous one (start is less than previous but end is larger)

```
class Solution:
    def removeCoveredIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort(key = lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
        res = 0
        
        prev_end = 0
        for _,end in intervals:
            # prev_start larger than start (sorted)
            # When prev_end < end means this interval is not covered by the last one 
            if prev_end < end:
                res += 1
                # If and only if when end is larger than prev_end
                #   will we update the end value 
                prev_end = end
        return res
```
