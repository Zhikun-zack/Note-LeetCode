## 277 Find the Celebrity M

### Description



Suppose you are at a party with `n` people labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other `n - 1` people know the celebrity, but the celebrity does not know any of them.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing you are allowed to do is ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information about whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given a helper function `bool knows(a, b)` that tells you whether A knows B. Implement a function `int findCelebrity(n)`. There will be exactly one celebrity if they are at the party.

Return _the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity at the party_. If there is no celebrity, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/01/19/g1.jpg)

```
Input: graph = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph[i][j] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph[i][j] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/01/19/g2.jpg)

```
Input: graph = [[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no celebrity.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `n == graph.length`
* `n == graph[i].length`
* `2 <= n <= 100`
* `graph[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
* `graph[i][i] == 1`

### Solution

* !!!! Two factors:&#x20;
  1. celebrity must not know any one
  2. celebrity must be known by anyone
* If knows(a, b) return false: a does not know b, b must not be celebrity (factor 2)
* If knows(a, b) return true: a know b, a must not be celebrity (factor 1)
* Each time you run knows, you can remove one guy
* Using one loop, get one candidate&#x20;
* But this candidate may not be the celebrity
* Have to loop again to prove this candidate is celebrity

```
// Some code
# The knows API is already defined for you.
# return a bool, whether a knows b
# def knows(a: int, b: int) -> bool:

class Solution:
    def findCelebrity(self, n: int) -> int:
        idx = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if knows(idx, i):
                idx = i
            else:
                continue
        for i in range(n):
            if i == idx:
                continue
            if  (not knows(i, idx)) or knows(idx, i):
                return -1
        return idx
```
