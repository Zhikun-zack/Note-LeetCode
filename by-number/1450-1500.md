* [ ] 1498 Number of Subsequences That Satisfy the Given Sum Condition



## 1498 Number of Subsequences That Satisfy the Given Sum Condition M

### D



You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`.

Return _the number of **non-empty** subsequences of_ `nums` _such that the sum of the minimum and maximum element on it is less or equal to_ `target`. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,5,6,7], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 subsequences that satisfy the condition.
[3] -> Min value + max value <= target (3 + 3 <= 9)
[3,5] -> (3 + 5 <= 9)
[3,5,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)
[3,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,3,6,8], target = 10
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 subsequences that satisfy the condition. (nums can have repeated numbers).
[3] , [3] , [3,3], [3,6] , [3,6] , [3,3,6]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,3,4,6,7], target = 12
Output: 61
Explanation: There are 63 non-empty subsequences, two of them do not satisfy the condition ([6,7], [7]).
Number of valid subsequences (63 - 2 = 61).
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 106`
* `1 <= target <= 106`

### S

* sort first&#x20;
* iterate through nums
* using binary search to find the right boundary
* using math to get the total number of combination if range between l and r and include l
*   \*If change `bisect_right` _to `bisect_left` _ then will cause error

    Since `bisect_right` is equal to `bisect_left` if value is not in list, so in this situation will be fine

    But when value is in the list, `bisect_left` will return the first value which is equal to the number that we searched in the list, which will discard all the other equal value, so the result will not be correct

```
class Solution:
    def numSubseq(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        if nums[0]*2 > target:
            return 0
    
        res = 0
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            l = nums[i]
            r = target - l
            if nums[i]*2 > target:
                break
            b = bisect_right(nums, r)
            res += pow(2, b-i-1, 10**9 + 7)
        return res % (10**9 + 7)
```
