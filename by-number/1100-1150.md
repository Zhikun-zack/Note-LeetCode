## 1110 Delete Nodes And Return Forest M

### D



Given the `root` of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.

After deleting all nodes with a value in `to_delete`, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).

Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest. You may return the result in any order.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/07/01/screen-shot-2019-07-01-at-53836-pm.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,4,null,3], to_delete = [3]
Output: [[1,2,4]]
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the given tree is at most `1000`.
* Each node has a distinct value between `1` and `1000`.
* `to_delete.length <= 1000`
* `to_delete` contains distinct values between `1` and `1000`.

### S

* DFS or BFS
* If current node is root and has not been deleted push it to res list
* \*Make sure the nodes in to\_delete are deleted

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def delNodes(self, root, to_delete):
        to_delete_set = set(to_delete)
        res = []

        def helper(root, is_root):
            if not root: return None
            root_deleted = root.val in to_delete_set
            if is_root and not root_deleted:
                res.append(root)
            root.left = helper(root.left, root_deleted)
            root.right = helper(root.right, root_deleted)
            # make sure the nodes in to_delete are deleted
            # If do as normal DFS, then elements in res will be the tree which haven't delete any nodes
            return None if root_deleted else root
        helper(root, True)
        return res

```

## 1137 N-th Tribonacci Number

### Description

The Tribonacci sequence Tn is defined as follows:

T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1, and Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n >= 0.

Given `n`, return the value of Tn.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
T_3 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
T_4 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 25
Output: 1389537
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= n <= 37`
* The answer is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit integer, ie. `answer <= 2^31 - 1`.

### Solution

```
// DP space O(1)
class Solution:
    def tribonacci(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0: return 0
        
        T0, T1, T2, res = 0, 1, 1, 1
        
        for i in range(3, n+1):
            tmp = T2
            T2 = T2+T1+T0
            T0 = T1
            T1 = tmp
        
        return T2
```
