## 1578 Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful M

### Description



Alice has `n` balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a **0-indexed** string `colors` where `colors[i]` is the color of the `ith` balloon.

Alice wants the rope to be **colorful**. She does not want **two consecutive balloons** to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it **colorful**. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `neededTime` where `neededTime[i]` is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the `ith` balloon from the rope.

Return _the **minimum time** Bob needs to make the rope **colorful**_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/ballon1.jpg)

```
Input: colors = "abaac", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: In the above image, 'a' is blue, 'b' is red, and 'c' is green.
Bob can remove the blue balloon at index 2. This takes 3 seconds.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/balloon2.jpg)

```
Input: colors = "abc", neededTime = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: The rope is already colorful. Bob does not need to remove any balloons from the rope.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/balloon3.jpg)

```
Input: colors = "aabaa", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Bob will remove the ballons at indices 0 and 4. Each ballon takes 1 second to remove.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 1 + 1 = 2.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `n == colors.length == neededTime.length`
* `1 <= n <= 105`
* `1 <= neededTime[i] <= 104`
* `colors` contains only lowercase English letters.

### Solution

* Regard one set of continuous ballon as a group, find the max value of it and calculate the sum of all cost of this group
* Keep the ballon with the max cost and remove the others will get the cheapest solution, which is (sum - max)
* e.g.:
* a a a a b b c c c      --- color
* 3 7 9 2 2 9 3 3 5    --- cost
* &#x20;      \|         |        |
* Keep these three will get the result

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, s: str, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        n = len(cost)
        i = 0
        
        while i < n:
            max_in_group = 0
            sum_of_group = 0
            col_of_group = s[i]
            while i < n and s[i] == col_of_group:
                max_in_group = max(max_in_group, cost[i])
                sum_of_group += cost[i]
                i += 1
            res += (sum_of_group - max_in_group)
        return res
                
```
