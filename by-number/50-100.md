## 63. Unique Paths II

### Description

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a `m x n` grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot1.jpg)

```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot2.jpg)

```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

* `m == obstacleGrid.length`
* `n == obstacleGrid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 100`
* `obstacleGrid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

### Solution

1. Using DP, dp\[i]\[j]: number of ways move from starter to (i,j)
2.  Initialize DP array; the first row equals to former value or 0 (if has obstacle)

    the first column equals to upper value or 0
3. Transition function: dp\[i]\[j] = dp\[i]\[j-1] + dp\[i-1]\[j]
4. Special condition: has obstacle, change dp\[i]\[j] to 0
5. return dp\[r\_len-1]\[\_c\_len-1]
6. **Advance: not create dp; just change the value in obstacle aray**

        m = len(obstacleGrid)

        # If the starting cell has an obstacle, then simply return as there would be
        # no paths to the destination.

        obstacleGrid[0][0] = 1

        for i in range(1,m):
            obstacleGrid[i][0] = int(obstacleGrid[i][0] == 0 and obstacleGrid[i-1][0] == 1)

        # No. of ways of reaching cell[i][j] = cell[i - 1][j] + cell[i][j - 1]
        # i.e. From above and left.

            for j in range(1,n):
                if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0:
                    obstacleGrid[i][j] = obstacleGrid[i-1][j] + obstacleGrid[i][j-1]
                else:
                    obstacleGrid[i][j] = 0

        # Return value stored in rightmost bottommost cell. That is the destination.            
        return obstacleGrid[m-1][n-1]

## 94 Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

### Description



Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the inorder traversal of its nodes' values_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/inorder\_1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

### Solution

```
// Iteration
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def inorderTraversal(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        return self.inorderTraversal(root.left) + [root.val] + self.inorderTraversal(root.right) if root else []
```
