## 63. Unique Paths II

### Description



A robot is located at the top-left corner of a `m x n` grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot1.jpg)

```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot2.jpg)

```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 1
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `m == obstacleGrid.length`
* `n == obstacleGrid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 100`
* `obstacleGrid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

### Solution

1. Using DP, dp\[i]\[j]: number of ways move from starter to (i,j)
2.  Initialize DP array; the first row equals to former value or 0 (if has obstacle)

    &#x20;                              the first column equals to upper value or 0
3. Transition function: dp\[i]\[j] = dp\[i]\[j-1] + dp\[i-1]\[j]
4. Special condition: has obstacle, change dp\[i]\[j] to 0
5. return dp\[r\_len-1]\[_c_len-1]
6. **Advance: not create dp; just change the value in obstacle aray**
