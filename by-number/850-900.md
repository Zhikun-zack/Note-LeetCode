## 881 Boats to Save People M

### Description



You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the `ith` person, and an **infinite number of boats** where each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return _the minimum number of boats to carry every given person_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= people.length <= 5 * 104`
* `1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 3 * 104`

### Solution

* Greedy and two pointers
* Sort first
* Find largest and smallest
* Each boat max carry two people

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        people.sort()
        i, j = 0, len(people)-1
        res = 0
        
        while i <= j:
            res += 1
            if people[i] + people[j] <= limit:
                i += 1
            j -= 1
        return res
```

## 871 Minimum Number of Refueling Stops H

### Description



A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is `target` miles east of the starting position.

There are gas stations along the way. The gas stations are represented as an array `stations` where `stations[i] = [positioni, fueli]` indicates that the `ith` gas station is `positioni` miles east of the starting position and has `fueli` liters of gas.

The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has `startFuel` liters of fuel in it. It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives. When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.

Return _the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination_. If it cannot reach the destination, return `-1`.

Note that if the car reaches a gas station with `0` fuel left, the car can still refuel there. If the car reaches the destination with `0` fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = []
Output: 0
Explanation: We can reach the target without refueling.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = [[10,100]]
Output: -1
Explanation: We can not reach the target (or even the first gas station).
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations = [[10,60],[20,30],[30,30],[60,40]]
Output: 2
Explanation: We start with 10 liters of fuel.
We drive to position 10, expending 10 liters of fuel.  We refuel from 0 liters to 60 liters of gas.
Then, we drive from position 10 to position 60 (expending 50 liters of fuel),
and refuel from 10 liters to 50 liters of gas.  We then drive to and reach the target.
We made 2 refueling stops along the way, so we return 2.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= target, startFuel <= 109`
* `0 <= stations.length <= 500`
* `0 <= positioni <= positioni+1 < target`
* `1 <= fueli < 109`

### Solution



```

class Solution:
    def minRefuelStops(self, target: int, startFuel: int, stations: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        hp = []
        stations.append((target, float('inf')))
        
        res = prev = 0
        for cur, capacity in stations:
            startFuel -= cur - prev
            while hp and startFuel<0:
                startFuel += -heapq.heappop(hp)
                res += 1
            if startFuel < 0:
                return -1
            heapq.heappush(hp, -capacity)
            prev = cur
        return res
```

## 875 Koko Eating Bananas M

### D



Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `ith` pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return _the minimum integer_ `k` _such that she can eat all the bananas within_ `h` _hours_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= piles.length <= 104`
* `piles.length <= h <= 109`
* `1 <= piles[i] <= 109`

### S

*   Binary search need to find a range

    Which is from 0 to max length of one pile
* If eat n per hour is the res then eat n+1 per hour will also eat all bananas, but not the slowest solution

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:  
        # Initalize the left and right boundaries     
        left = 1
        right = max(piles)
        
        while left < right:
            # Get the middle index between left and right boundary indexes.
            # hour_spent stands for the total hour Koko spends.
            middle = (left + right) // 2            
            hour_spent = 0
            
            # Iterate over the piles and calculate hour_spent.
            # We increase the hour_spent by ceil(pile / middle)
            for pile in piles:
                hour_spent += math.ceil(pile / middle)
            
            # Check if middle is a workable speed, and cut the search space by half.
            if hour_spent <= h:
                right = middle
            else:
                left = middle + 1
        
        # Once the left and right boundaries coincide, we find the target value,
        # that is, the minimum workable eating speed.
        return right
```
