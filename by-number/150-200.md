## 198 House Robber

### Description

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`

### Solution

```
// DP with O(N) space
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums_len = len(nums)
        
        if not nums: 
            return 0
        if nums_len == 1:
            return nums[0]
        
        dp = [0 for _ in range(len(nums))]
        dp[0] = nums[0]
        dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])
        
        
        for i in range(2, nums_len):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], nums[i]+dp[i-2])
        return dp[nums_len-1]
```

// Improved DP with O(1) space
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums_len = len(nums)
        
        if not nums: 
            return 0
        if nums_len == 1:
            return nums[0]
        
        rob_prev = nums[0]
        rob = max(nums[0], nums[1])
        res = max(rob_prev, rob)
        
        for i in range(2, nums_len):
            res = max(rob, rob_prev + nums[i])
            rob_prev = rob
            rob = res
        return res
```
