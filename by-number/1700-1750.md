## 1712 Ways to Split Array Into Three Subarrays M

### Description



A split of an integer array is **good** if:

* The array is split into three **non-empty** contiguous subarrays - named `left`, `mid`, `right` respectively from left to right.
* The sum of the elements in `left` is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in `mid`, and the sum of the elements in `mid` is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in `right`.

Given `nums`, an array of **non-negative** integers, return _the number of **good** ways to split_ `nums`. As the number may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only good way to split nums is [1] [1] [1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,2,5,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three good ways of splitting nums:
[1] [2] [2,2,5,0]
[1] [2,2] [2,5,0]
[1,2] [2,2] [5,0]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no good way to split nums.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `3 <= nums.length <= 105`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 104`

### Solution

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def waysToSplit(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        # prefix list
        pre = list(accumulate(nums))
        # 用小于2**31的大质数取模，防止溢出
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        for i in range (len(nums)):
            # Find left range of mid and right border index
            # Find mid index where pre[mid] - pre[i] = pre[i] (if mid go left, then pre[mid]-pre[i] will less than pre[i]
            #   then mid will less than left)
            # Second value of bisect_left is the value that we need to find a position to insert, which is pre[mid] = pre[i] + pre[i]
            l = max(i+1, bisect_left(pre, 2*pre[i]))
            # right range
            # Find when pre[-1] - pre[mid] = pre[mid] - pre[i] (mid cannot go right)
            # pre[mid] = (pre[-1] + pre[i]) // 2
            r = min(len(nums)-1, bisect_right(pre, (pre[i] + pre[-1])//2))
            res = (res + max(0, r-l)%mod)
        return res%mod
```
