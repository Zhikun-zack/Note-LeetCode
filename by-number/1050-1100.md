## 1060 Missing Element in Sorted Array M

### D



Given an integer array `nums` which is sorted in **ascending order** and all of its elements are **unique** and given also an integer `k`, return the `kth` missing number starting from the leftmost number of the array.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,7,9,10], k = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: The first missing number is 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,7,9,10], k = 3
Output: 8
Explanation: The missing numbers are [5,6,8,...], hence the third missing number is 8.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,4], k = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing numbers are [3,5,6,7,...], hence the third missing number is 6.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 107`
* `nums` is sorted in **ascending order,** and all the elements are **unique**.
* `1 <= k <= 108`

### S

```
class Solution:
    def missingElement(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Return how many numbers are missing until nums[idx]
        missing = lambda idx: nums[idx] - nums[0] - idx
            
        n = len(nums)
        # If kth missing number is larger than 
        # the last element of the array
        if k > missing(n - 1):
            return nums[-1] + k - missing(n - 1) 
        
        left, right = 0, n - 1
        # find left = right index such that 
        # missing(left - 1) < k <= missing(left)
        while left != right:
            pivot = left + (right - left) // 2
            
            if missing(pivot) < k:
                left = pivot + 1
            else:
                right = pivot 
        
        # kth missing number is greater than nums[left - 1]
        # and less than nums[left]
        return nums[left - 1] + k - missing(left - 1) 
```

## 1094 Car Pooling M

### D



There is a car with `capacity` empty seats. The vehicle only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).

You are given the integer `capacity` and an array `trips` where `trips[i] = [numPassengersi, fromi, toi]` indicates that the `ith` trip has `numPassengersi` passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them off are `fromi` and `toi` respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's initial location.

Return `true` _if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
Output: false
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
Output: true
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= trips.length <= 1000`
* `trips[i].length == 3`
* `1 <= numPassengersi <= 100`
* `0 <= fromi < toi <= 1000`
* `1 <= capacity <= 105`

### S

* Split trips list to two lists --> \[timestamp, number of passengers change]
* One is at the start, passengers change is positive
* Another one is the end, change is negative
* Sort&#x20;
* Traverse the new sorted list, maintain a var to store the total number of passengers on the car
* If exceed, return false

```
class Solution:
    def carPooling(self, trips: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
        timestamp = []
        for trip in trips:
            timestamp.append([trip[1], trip[0]])
            timestamp.append([trip[2], -trip[0]])

        timestamp.sort()

        used_capacity = 0
        for time, passenger_change in timestamp:
            used_capacity += passenger_change
            if used_capacity > capacity:
                return False

        return True
```

Second ways: bucket sort --> we need to know the limitation of the list first, otherwise not be able to use this way

* Create a bucket first
* Insert the split list into the bucket&#x20;
* traverse

```
class Solution:
    def carPooling(self, trips: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
        timestamp = [0] * 1001
        for trip in trips:
            timestamp[trip[1]] += trip[0]
            timestamp[trip[2]] -= trip[0]

        used_capacity = 0
        for passenger_change in timestamp:
            used_capacity += passenger_change
            if used_capacity > capacity:
                return False

        return True
```
