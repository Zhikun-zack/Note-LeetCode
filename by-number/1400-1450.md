## 1423 Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards M

### Description



There are several cards **arranged in a row**, and each card has an associated number of points. The points are given in the integer array `cardPoints`.

In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly `k` cards.

Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.

Given the integer array `cardPoints` and the integer `k`, return the _maximum score_ you can obtain.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: After the first step, your score will always be 1. However, choosing the rightmost card first will maximize your total score. The optimal strategy is to take the three cards on the right, giving a final score of 1 + 6 + 5 = 12.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: cardPoints = [2,2,2], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Regardless of which two cards you take, your score will always be 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: cardPoints = [9,7,7,9,7,7,9], k = 7
Output: 55
Explanation: You have to take all the cards. Your score is the sum of points of all cards.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= cardPoints.length <= 105`
* `1 <= cardPoints[i] <= 104`
* `1 <= k <= cardPoints.length`

### &#x20;Solution

* Only get value from two sides
* Get max sum = get min of the rest&#x20;
* rest can use sliding window

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def maxScore(self, cardPoints: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(cardPoints)
        rev_sum = sum(cardPoints[0: n-k])
        rev_res = rev_sum
        
        for l in range(1, k+1):
            rev_sum -= cardPoints[l-1]
            rev_sum += cardPoints[l+n-k-1]
            rev_res = min(rev_sum, rev_res)
        return sum(cardPoints) - rev_res
```

## 1428 Leftmost Column with at Least a One M

### D



A **row-sorted binary matrix** means that all elements are `0` or `1` and each row of the matrix is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given a **row-sorted binary matrix** `binaryMatrix`, return _the index (0-indexed) of the **leftmost column** with a 1 in it_. If such an index does not exist, return `-1`.

**You can't access the Binary Matrix directly.** You may only access the matrix using a `BinaryMatrix` interface:

* `BinaryMatrix.get(row, col)` returns the element of the matrix at index `(row, col)` (0-indexed).
* `BinaryMatrix.dimensions()` returns the dimensions of the matrix as a list of 2 elements `[rows, cols]`, which means the matrix is `rows x cols`.

Submissions making more than `1000` calls to `BinaryMatrix.get` will be judged _Wrong Answer_. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.

For custom testing purposes, the input will be the entire binary matrix `mat`. You will not have access to the binary matrix directly.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/25/untitled-diagram-5.jpg)

```
Input: mat = [[0,0],[1,1]]
Output: 0
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/25/untitled-diagram-4.jpg)

```
Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,1]]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/25/untitled-diagram-3.jpg)

```
Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,0]]
Output: -1
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `rows == mat.length`
* `cols == mat[i].length`
* `1 <= rows, cols <= 100`
* `mat[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
* `mat[i]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
