* [ ] 1838 Frequency of the Most Frequent Element

## 1838 Frequency of the Most Frequent Element M

### Description



The **frequency** of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can choose an index of `nums` and increment the element at that index by `1`.

Return _the **maximum possible frequency** of an element after performing **at most** _ `k` _operations_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,4], k = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: Increment the first element three times and the second element two times to make nums = [4,4,4].
4 has a frequency of 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,4,8,13], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: There are multiple optimal solutions:
- Increment the first element three times to make nums = [4,4,8,13]. 4 has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the second element four times to make nums = [1,8,8,13]. 8 has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the third element five times to make nums = [1,4,13,13]. 13 has a frequency of 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3,9,6], k = 2
Output: 1
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`
* `1 <= k <= 105`

### Solution

* Sliding window

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def maxFrequency(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        l = 0
        res = 1
        window_sum = 0
        n = len(nums)
        
        nums.sort()
        
        for r in range(n):
            # add r value
            window_sum += nums[r]
            # if total operation time in sliding window larger than k
            # pop l 
            while nums[r] * (r-l+1) - window_sum > k:
                window_sum -= nums[l]
                l += 1
            res = max(res, r-l+1)
        return res
            
```

* Sliding window + prefix + binary search

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def maxFrequency(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        nums.sort()
        # prefix list (len will be one bit longer than nums)
        presum = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            presum[i] = presum[i-1] + nums[i-1]
        
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            # left boundary of sliding windows' left 
            L = 1
            # right boundary of sliding windows' right
            R = i
            # Using binary search to search windows' left 
            while L < R:
                mid = L + R >> 1
                if nums[i-1] * (i - mid + 1) - (presum[i] - presum[mid - 1]) <= k:
                    R = mid
                else:
                    L = mid + 1
            res = max(res, i - L + 1)

        return res

```
