* [x] 605 Can Place Flowers



## 605 Can Place Flowers E

### Description



You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in **adjacent** plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return _if_ `n` new flowers can be planted in the `flowerbed` without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104`
* `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`.
* There are no two adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`.
* `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`

### Solution

* O(N) O(1)
* Go through all element one time, if empty, visit its left and right plots
* return true when plantable plots equal to n
* else return false&#x20;

```

            if flowerbed[i] == 0:
                # Check if the left and right plots are empty.
                empty_left_plot = (i == 0) or (flowerbed[i - 1] == 0)
                empty_right_lot = (i == len(flowerbed) - 1) or (flowerbed[i + 1] == 0)
                
                # If both plots are empty, we can plant a flower here.
                if empty_left_plot and empty_right_lot:
                    flowerbed[i] = 1
                    count += 1
                    if count >= n:
                        return True
                    
        return count >= n
