## 605 Can Place Flowers E

### Description



You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in **adjacent** plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return _if_ `n` new flowers can be planted in the `flowerbed` without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104`
* `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`.
* There are no two adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`.
* `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`

### Solution

* O(N) O(1)
* Go through all element one time, if empty, visit its left and right plots
* return true when plantable plots equal to n
* else return false&#x20;

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(flowerbed)):
            # Check if the current plot is empty.
            if flowerbed[i] == 0:
                # Check if the left and right plots are empty.
                empty_left_plot = (i == 0) or (flowerbed[i - 1] == 0)
                empty_right_lot = (i == len(flowerbed) - 1) or (flowerbed[i + 1] == 0)
                
                # If both plots are empty, we can plant a flower here.
                if empty_left_plot and empty_right_lot:
                    flowerbed[i] = 1
                    count += 1
                    if count >= n:
                        return True
                    
        return count >= n
```

## 617 Merge Two Binary Trees

### D



You are given two binary trees `root1` and `root2`.

Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not. You need to merge the two trees into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of the new tree.

Return _the merged tree_.

**Note:** The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root1 = [1,3,2,5], root2 = [2,1,3,null,4,null,7]
Output: [3,4,5,5,4,null,7]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root1 = [1], root2 = [1,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

### S

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def mergeTrees(self, root1: Optional[TreeNode], root2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root1:
            return root2
        if not root2:
            return root1
        
        res = TreeNode(root1.val + root2.val)
        res.left = self.mergeTrees(root1.left, root2.left)
        res.right = self.mergeTrees(root1.right, root2.right)
        
        return res
```
