## 746 Min Cost Climbing Stairs

### Description



You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `ith` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return _the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: cost = [10,15,20]
Output: 15
Explanation: You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`

### Solution

```
// DP space O(N)
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        cost_len = len(cost)
        
        # dp[i] is the min cost to go position i
        dp = [0 for _ in range(cost_len+1)]
        
        for i in range(2, cost_len+1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i-1]+cost[i-1], dp[i-2]+cost[i-2])
        return dp[cost_len]
        
```

```
// DP space O(1)
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        cost_len = len(cost)
        
        dp_1 = 0
        dp_2 = 0
        
        for i in range(2, cost_len+1):
            tmp = dp_1
            dp_1 = min(dp_1+cost[i-1],dp_2+cost[i-2])
            dp_2 = tmp
            
        return dp_1
