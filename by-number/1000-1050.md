## 1004 Max Consecutive Ones III M

### Description



Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the maximum number of consecutive_ `1`_'s in the array if you can flip at most_ `k` `0`'s.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
* `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.
* `0 <= k <= nums.length`

### Solution&#x20;

* If used all k, just move left pointer one bit ahead

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        l = 0
        for r in range(len(nums)):
            # if nums[r] is 0, k will minus 1
            # if nums[r] is 1, k don't have to minus 1
            k -= 1-nums[r]
            if k < 0:
                # if nums[l] is 0, after remove l, k have to plus 1
                # else k don't have to do any change
                k += 1-nums[l]
                l += 1
        return r - l + 1
```

## 1011 Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days M

### Description



A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within `days` days.

The `ith` package on the conveyor belt has a weight of `weights[i]`. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by `weights`). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.

Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within `days` days.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], days = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], days = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
1st day: 3, 2
2nd day: 2, 4
3rd day: 1, 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], days = 4
Output: 3
Explanation:
1st day: 1
2nd day: 2
3rd day: 3
4th day: 1, 1
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= days <= weights.length <= 5 * 104`
* `1 <= weights[i] <= 500`

### Solution'

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], days: int) -> int:
        l, r = max(weights), sum(weights)
        while l < r:
            mid = (l+r) >> 1;
            if self.check(weights, mid, days):
                r = mid
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        return l
    # check out whether the day max works         
    def check(self, weights, mid, days):
        n = len(weights)
        i = 1
        # number of days need when max capacity is mid
        split_day = 1
        day_weight = weights[0]
        while i < n:
            
            while i < n and day_weight + weights[i] <= mid:
                day_weight += weights[i]
                i += 1
            day_weight = 0
            split_day += 1
        return split_day - 1 <= days
```

## 1024 Video Stitching M

### Description



You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted `time` seconds. These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varying lengths.

Each video clip is described by an array `clips` where `clips[i] = [starti, endi]` indicates that the ith clip started at `starti` and ended at `endi`.

We can cut these clips into segments freely.

* For example, a clip `[0, 7]` can be cut into segments `[0, 1] + [1, 3] + [3, 7]`.

Return _the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event_ `[0, time]`. If the task is impossible, return `-1`.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: clips = [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]], time = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: We take the clips [0,2], [8,10], [1,9]; a total of 3 clips.
Then, we can reconstruct the sporting event as follows:
We cut [1,9] into segments [1,2] + [2,8] + [8,9].
Now we have segments [0,2] + [2,8] + [8,10] which cover the sporting event [0, 10].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: clips = [[0,1],[1,2]], time = 5
Output: -1
Explanation: We cannot cover [0,5] with only [0,1] and [1,2].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: clips = [[0,1],[6,8],[0,2],[5,6],[0,4],[0,3],[6,7],[1,3],[4,7],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6],[3,4],[4,5],[5,7],[6,9]], time = 9
Output: 3
Explanation: We can take clips [0,4], [4,7], and [6,9].
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= clips.length <= 100`
* `0 <= starti <= endi <= 100`
* `1 <= time <= 100`

### Solution

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def videoStitching(self, clips: List[List[int]], time: int) -> int:
        farthest = [0]*time
        last = end = res = 0
        
        for a, b in clips:
            if a < time:
                farthest[a] = max(farthest[a], b)
            
        for i in range(time):
            last = max(farthest[i], last)
            if i == last:
                return -1
            if i == end:
                end = last
                res += 1
        return res
```



## 1029 Two City Scheduling M

### Description



A company is planning to interview `2n` people. Given the array `costs` where `costs[i] = [aCosti, bCosti]`, the cost of flying the `ith` person to city `a` is `aCosti`, and the cost of flying the `ith` person to city `b` is `bCosti`.

Return _the minimum cost to fly every person to a city_ such that exactly `n` people arrive in each city.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: costs = [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
Output: 110
Explanation: 
The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.

The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: costs = [[259,770],[448,54],[926,667],[184,139],[840,118],[577,469]]
Output: 1859
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: costs = [[515,563],[451,713],[537,709],[343,819],[855,779],[457,60],[650,359],[631,42]]
Output: 3086
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `2 * n == costs.length`
* `2 <= costs.length <= 100`
* `costs.length` is even.
* `1 <= aCosti, bCosti <= 1000`

### Solution

Sort based on value of price A - price B

```
// 
class Solution:
    def twoCitySchedCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Sort by priceA - priceB
        # Larger means price B is cheaper, smaller is A is better
        costs.sort(key = lambda x: x[0] - x[1])
        
        res = 0
        n = len(costs)
        for i in range(n//2):
            res += costs[i][0] + costs[i + n//2][1]
        return res
```
