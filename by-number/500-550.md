## 510 Inorder Successor in BST II M

### D



Given a `node` in a binary search tree, return _the in-order successor of that node in the BST_. If that node has no in-order successor, return `null`.

The successor of a `node` is the node with the smallest key greater than `node.val`.

You will have direct access to the node but not to the root of the tree. Each node will have a reference to its parent node. Below is the definition for `Node`:

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
}
```

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/23/285\_example\_1.PNG)

```
Input: tree = [2,1,3], node = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both the node and the return value is of Node type.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/23/285\_example\_2.PNG)

```
Input: tree = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], node = 6
Output: null
Explanation: There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is null.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
* `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
* All Nodes will have unique values.

### S

* If node has right child: Find the left most node of its right child node
* If node has no right child: Go all the way up until find a node which is its parent's left child node, return its parent( If has value then return value if not return null)

```

## 524 Longest Word in Dictionary through Deleting M

### Description



Given a string `s` and a string array `dictionary`, return _the longest string in the dictionary that can be formed by deleting some of the given string characters_. If there is more than one possible result, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no possible result, return the empty string.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abpcplea", dictionary = ["ale","apple","monkey","plea"]
Output: "apple"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abpcplea", dictionary = ["a","b","c"]
Output: "a"
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 1000`
* `s` and `dictionary[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.

### Solution

1. Two pointers
2. Solve two problems:&#x20;
   1. How to know whether string in dictionary can become s by deleting
   2. How to return by lexicographic order if len is equal
3. Problem 2: sort dictionary by len first then charactristic
4. Problem 1: Two pointers, if two pointers point at same value, go next both; else pointer1 ++

```
// O(len(s) N ) O(N)
class Solution:
    def findLongestWord(self, s: str, dictionary: List[str]) -> str:
        # sort based on len, if len equal based on lexicographical
        dictionary.sort(key = lambda x: (-len(x), x))
        for i in dictionary:
            # pointer1 for s; 2 for i 
            pointer1 = pointer2 = 0
            while pointer2 < len(i) and pointer1 < len(s):
                if s[pointer1] == i[pointer2]:
                    pointer2 += 1
                pointer1 += 1
            # remove the situation when pointer1 == len(s) and find i can not be the word delete by s
            if pointer2 == len(i):
                return i
        return ""
                
```

## 540 Single Element in a Sorted Array M

### D



You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return _the single element that appears only once_.

Your solution must run in `O(log n)` time and `O(1)` space.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`

### S

* All numbers appear twice except one
* So we can based on the length of half of array is odd or not.

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def singleNonDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        l, r = 0, n-1
        
        if n == 1:
            return nums[0]
        
        while l < r:
            mid = l + (r-l)//2;
            half_even = (r - mid)%2 == 0
            
            if nums[mid] == nums[mid+1]:
                if half_even:
                    l = mid + 2
                else:
                    r = mid - 1
            elif nums[mid-1] == nums[mid]:
                if half_even:
                    r = mid - 2
                else:
                    l = mid + 1
            else:
                return nums[mid]
        return nums[l]
```
