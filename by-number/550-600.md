## 576. Out of Boundary Paths

### Description

There is an `m x n` grid with a ball. The ball is initially at the position `[startRow, startColumn]`. You are allowed to move the ball to one of the four adjacent cells in the grid (possibly out of the grid crossing the grid boundary). You can apply **at most** `maxMove` moves to the ball.

Given the five integers `m`, `n`, `maxMove`, `startRow`, `startColumn`, return the number of paths to move the ball out of the grid boundary. Since the answer can be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/28/out\_of\_boundary\_paths\_1.png)

```
Input: m = 2, n = 2, maxMove = 2, startRow = 0, startColumn = 0
Output: 6
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/28/out\_of\_boundary\_paths\_2.png)

```
Input: m = 1, n = 3, maxMove = 3, startRow = 0, startColumn = 1
Output: 12
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= m, n <= 50`
* `0 <= maxMove <= 50`
* `0 <= startRow < m`
* `0 <= startColumn < n`

### `Solution`

```
// Some code
class Solution:
    def findPaths(self, m: int, n: int, maxMove: int, startRow: int, startColumn: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        outCounts = 0
        dp = [[[0] * n for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(maxMove + 1)]
        dp[0][startRow][startColumn] = 1
        for i in range(maxMove):
            for j in range(m):
                for k in range(n):
                    if dp[i][j][k] > 0:
                        for j1, k1 in [(j - 1, k), (j + 1, k), (j, k - 1), (j, k + 1)]:
                            if 0 <= j1 < m and 0 <= k1 < n:
                                dp[i + 1][j1][k1] = (dp[i + 1][j1][k1] + dp[i][j][k]) % MOD
                            else:
                                outCounts = (outCounts + dp[i][j][k]) % MOD
        
        return outCounts

```
