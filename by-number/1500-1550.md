* [ ] 1539 Kth Missing Positive Number

## 1539 Kth Missing Positive Number E

### D



Given an array `arr` of positive integers sorted in a **strictly increasing order**, and an integer `k`.

_Find the_ `kth` _positive integer that is missing from this array._

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
* `1 <= k <= 1000`
* `arr[i] < arr[j]` for `1 <= i < j <= arr.length`

### S

* The number of missed value from arr\[0] to arr\[i] is arr\[i] - (i+1)
* So if this value larger than k, means right part will miss larger than k value
* if less than k, means left part will miss less than k value

```
class Solution:
    def findKthPositive(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(arr) - 1
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l+r)//2
            
            if arr[mid] - mid - 1 < k:
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                r = mid - 1
        return l + k
```
