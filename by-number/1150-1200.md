## 1166 Design File System M

### D



You are asked to design a file system that allows you to create new paths and associate them with different values.

The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: `/` followed by one or more lowercase English letters. For example, "`/leetcode"` and "`/leetcode/problems"` are valid paths while an empty string `""` and `"/"` are not.

Implement the `FileSystem` class:

* `bool createPath(string path, int value)` Creates a new `path` and associates a `value` to it if possible and returns `true`. Returns `false` if the path **already exists** or its parent path **doesn't exist**.
* `int get(string path)` Returns the value associated with `path` or returns `-1` if the path doesn't exist.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
["FileSystem","createPath","get"]
[[],["/a",1],["/a"]]
Output: 
[null,true,1]
Explanation: 
FileSystem fileSystem = new FileSystem();

fileSystem.createPath("/a", 1); // return true
fileSystem.get("/a"); // return 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
["FileSystem","createPath","createPath","get","createPath","get"]
[[],["/leet",1],["/leet/code",2],["/leet/code"],["/c/d",1],["/c"]]
Output: 
[null,true,true,2,false,-1]
Explanation: 
FileSystem fileSystem = new FileSystem();

fileSystem.createPath("/leet", 1); // return true
fileSystem.createPath("/leet/code", 2); // return true
fileSystem.get("/leet/code"); // return 2
fileSystem.createPath("/c/d", 1); // return false because the parent path "/c" doesn't exist.
fileSystem.get("/c"); // return -1 because this path doesn't exist.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* The number of calls to the two functions is less than or equal to `104` in total.
* `2 <= path.length <= 100`
* `1 <= value <= 109`

**Algorithm**

1. The basic data structure that is used for representing a Trie is a dictionary. The dictionary and other potential flags/data values can be a part of a custom `TreeNode` data structure. For this problem, we will have a `TrieNode` data structure that will contain three things 1. The string representing the path name. 2. The value corresponding to this path. 3. And finally, a dictionary representing the outgoing connections to other `TrieNodes`.
2. The root of our trie will be a `TrieNode` containing the empty string.
3. _Create()_ \~
   1.  First, we will split the given path into various components using `/` as the delimiter. So for the path `/a/b/c`, we will have four components namely , `a`, `b`, and `c`.

       _Figure 3. Let's consider an example Trie._
   2.  Initialize a `TrieNode` called `curr` which will be equal to the root node of the trie. Note that we always start at the root node and then go down based on the various path components.

       <img src="https://leetcode.com/problems/design-file-system/Figures/1166/img4.png" alt="HashMap" data-size="original">

       _Figure 4. Initialize the "curr" node._
   3. We will iterate over all of these components and for each of them, we will do the following:
      1. Check if the component exists in `curr`'s dictionary . If it doesn't we return false unless it is the last component of the path in which case we add it to the current dictionary.
      2. If the current component exists in the `curr` node, we obtain the value which will be another `TrieNode` and update `curr` to be equal to that node.
      3.  Eventually, we will process the last component of the path. If that exists in the trie as well, we return `false` in accordance with the problem statement. Else, we add it to the trie by creating a new node with path as `path` and value as `value` i.e. the input parameters.

          _Figure 5. Add the last component to the Trie._
4. _Get()_ \~
   1. To check if a path exists in the trie, we need to verify if all its components, along with the proper connections exist in the trie.
   2. Split the given path into various components using `/` as the delimiter.
   3. Initialize a `TrieNode` called `curr` which will be equal to the root node of the trie.
   4. We will iterate over all of these components and for each of them, we will do the following:
      1. Check if the component exists in `curr`'s dictionary .
      2. If the current component exists in the `curr` node, we obtain the value which will be another `TrieNode` and update `curr` to be equal to that node.
      3. If it doesn't exist, we return `false`.
   5. Return `true`.

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.map = defaultdict(TrieNode)
        self.name = name

    def __init__(self):

        # Start "curr" from the root node.

## 1171 Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes from Linked List M

### D



Given the `head` of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to `0` until there are no such sequences.

After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.  You may return any such answer.

&#x20;

(Note that in the examples below, all sequences are serializations of `ListNode` objects.)

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,-3,3,1]
Output: [3,1]
Note: The answer [1,2,1] would also be accepted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,4]
Output: [1,2,4]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,-2]
Output: [1]
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* The given linked list will contain between `1` and `1000` nodes.
* Each node in the linked list has `-1000 <= node.val <= 1000`.

### S

* Using prefix&#x20;
* Using hashmap to store prefix: key is prefix and value is the node (since any correct result is acceptable we can just store the latest node of that prefix)
* Two loops:&#x20;
  * first for initialization
  * second is the main loop
* In second loop: maintain a sum for sum of all current nodes
  * If cur sum is equal to one of the prefix means node between cur node and prefix node should be removed

class Solution:
    def removeZeroSumSublists(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head:
            return None
        
        res = ListNode(0, head)
        # pointer must be ahead of the original header
        head = res
        pre = collections.defaultdict(ListNode)
        cur_sum = 0
        
        while head:
            cur_sum += head.val
            pre[cur_sum] = head
            head = head.next
            
        cur_sum = 0
        # ** head must be ahead of the head of linkedlist, otherwise will not remove the first node in list
        head = res
        while head:
            cur_sum += head.val
            head.next = pre[cur_sum].next # If pre hashmap contains cur_sum, means the nodes in between should all be removed
            head = head.next
            
        return res.next
    
```
