## 26 Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array E

### Description



Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place\_algorithm) such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` _after placing the final result in the first_ `k` _slots of_ `nums`.

Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array** [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place\_algorithm) with O(1) extra memory.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
* `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
* `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

### Solution

* O(N) O(1)
* pointer1 point at the res list, pointer2 point at the given list
* If not same
  * pointer1 move to next
  * given pointer2's value to pointer1
  * pointer2 move to next
* If same
  * pointer2 move to next

```
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        pointer1, pointer2 = 0, 0
        while pointer1 < len(nums) and pointer2 < len(nums):
            if nums[pointer1] != nums[pointer2]:
                pointer1 += 1
                nums[pointer1] = nums[pointer2]
            pointer2 += 1
        print(nums)
        return pointer1+1
```

## 35 Search Insert Position E

### D



Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
* `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
* `nums` contains **distinct** values sorted in **ascending** order.
* `-104 <= target <= 104`

### S

```
class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1
        
        while l <= r:
            mid = l + (r - l) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            if nums[mid] > target:
                r = mid - 1
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        return l
```

or using `bisect_left` in python

```
class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        return bisect_left(nums, target)
```

## 41 First Missing Positive H

### D



Given an unsorted integer array `nums`, return the smallest missing positive integer.

You must implement an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses constant extra space.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,0]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 105`
* `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`

### S

* If not include 1, return 1
* Change all negative value and the value larger than n+1 to 1 (The largest missing value is n+1, if we want the missing value larger than n+1, which means we have to have n+1 values, but the length is n, can not be larger than n)
* Loop through, when visit index i, change the nums\[i] to negative (Look out the duplication, each nums\[i] should only be changed once)
* Loop through, find out the first value which is positive, that value's index is the missing number

```
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        
        # Base case.
        if 1 not in nums:
            return 1
        
        # Replace negative numbers, zeros,
        # and numbers larger than n by 1s.
        # After this convertion nums will contain 
        # only positive numbers.
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] <= 0 or nums[i] > n:
                nums[i] = 1
        
        # Use index as a hash key and number sign as a presence detector.
        # For example, if nums[1] is negative that means that number `1`
        # is present in the array. 
        # If nums[2] is positive - number 2 is missing.
        for i in range(n): 
            a = abs(nums[i])
            # If you meet number a in the array - change the sign of a-th element.
            # Be careful with duplicates : do it only once.
            if a == n:
                nums[0] = - abs(nums[0])
            else:
                nums[a] = - abs(nums[a]) # No matter nums[a] positive or not, result will always be negative
            
        # Now the index of the first positive number 
        # is equal to first missing positive.
        for i in range(1, n):
            if nums[i] > 0:
                return i
        
        if nums[0] > 0:
            return n
            
        return n + 1
```
