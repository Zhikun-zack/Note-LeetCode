# Sliding window

## Two pointers

sliding window problems should make sure moving right will only increase some value and moving left pointer should only decrease some value.

    (This problem is that kind of problems which can not be solved by normal sliding window, cuz moving right may introduce new char and not increase the old value.)

    make sure the other char in sliding window less than certain value
